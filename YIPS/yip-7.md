This is the suggested template for new YIPs. Note that an YIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your YIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `yip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Currently (and after the YIP-6 change), holding the YFII has no use other than governance. The YFII Machine gun pool has 0% APY, and has been giving no returns for 2 weeks, this needs to become the top #1 priority of the development team.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the YIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the YIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This change will add strategies for the YFII vault, that incentivize staking for YFII token holders. As the machine gun pool is supposed to look for better strategies for YFII holders, it is currently inactive. We demand that development on making the YFII vault active, becomes the top priority of the development team. 

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the YIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the YIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the YIP will address the issue!-->
We understand there are many other propositions and developments in the works for YFII, but its current value has been decreasing, coincidentally ever since people came to the realization YFII does not provide any farming benefits.
Farmers that hold other tokens are able to farm YFII, yet they have no reason to hold it. Even the upcoming iToken reward helps reward these farmers, yet again, there is nothing done to benefit the current holders of the YFII tokens.

This change will prioritize working on YFII rewards above all else, instantly creating a need not only to farm, but to buy, and stake YFII tokens. 

While this proposition sounds short-sighted, it is because it should almost be common sense. Other tokens like YFI, YFV, YFFI, all have staking mechanisms, that allow people to generate profits not from other tokens, but from the original token itself.
This YIP will help voice the community's concern, not only for this proposal, but sets the tone in the future, over if the team should focus on the benefit of YFII farmers, or focus on the benefit of other (DAI,yCRV,USDT,...) farmers.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the YIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

If this is implemented, the team will focus first on implementing new strategies for the YFII vault, above every other pool. As it is today, existing pools currently will be untouched, and will keep generating profits for their farmers, but the work will start focusing on YFII strategies, and how to create a need for acquiring and holding YFII tokens.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The problem this will solve is instantly create a need to put YFII tokens to use. At the date of this proposal, 57% of total YFII is deposited with exchanges, which are the top 3 YFII holders. This proves the point that YFII is not currently used for any purpose, other than being traded and sold. 

By fixing the YFII machine gun pool, we not only create a need for users to deposit their money into it, but invite others to purchase and hold their tokens in the vault.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces YFII Finance currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Just as other coins (yCRV, USDT, DAI) have strategies, YFII can be farmed the same way. There are liquidity pools, and multiple smart contract farms available for this.

It is also easily possible to reward YFII farmers with other tokens, which is still a lot better than no rewards. 

There is also YIP-5 which redistributes 5% to farmers, which should include YFII vault farmers.

There are many technical solutions to this problem, and I am confident in the developer and marketing team to find lucrative farming strategies for YFII farmers.

## 简单总结

目前（以及在YIP-6变更之后），持有YFII除了治理之外没有其他用途。 YFII机枪储备的APY为0％，并且在两周内没有回报，这需要成为开发团队的第一要务。

## 抽象

此更改将为YFII保险库添加策略，从而激励YFII代币持有者的权益。由于机枪总库应该为YFII持有人寻求更好的策略，因此目前处于无效状态。我们要求在使YFII保管库活跃化方面的开发成为开发团队的重中之重。

## 动机

我们知道YFII的作品还有很多其他主张和发展，但是它的当前价值一直在下降，这恰好是自人们意识到YFII并没有提供任何农业利益以来。持有其他代币的农民可以耕种YFII，但是他们没有理由持有它。即使即将到来的iToken奖励也有助于奖励这些农民，但是，仍然没有任何事情可以使YFII代币的现有持有人受益。

这项变更将优先处理YFII奖励，而不是首先进行耕种，购买和抵押YFII代币的需求。

虽然这个提议听起来是短视的，但这是因为它几乎应该是常识。 YFI，YFV，YFFI等其他代币均具有放样机制，该机制使人们能够从原始代币本身而不是从其他代币中获取利润。该YIP不仅有助于该提案，还有助于表达社区的关注，并为团队今后应该专注于YFII农民的利益，还是专注于其他人（DAI，yCRV，USDT， ...）农民。

## 规范

### 总览

如果实施了该计划，那么团队将首先专注于为YFII保险库实施新的策略，高于其他所有策略。与今天一样，目前的现有资金池将保持不变，并将继续为其农民创造利润，但是工作将开始侧重于YFII策略以及如何创造获取和持有YFII代币的需求。

### 基本原理

这将解决的问题是立即产生使用YFII令牌的需求。在本建议书提出之日，YFII总数的57％存放在交易所中，这是YFII的前三名。这证明了YFII目前除了交易和出售以外没有任何用途。

通过固定YFII机枪池，我们不仅需要用户将钱存入其中，还邀请其他人购买并将令牌保存在金库中。

### 技术指标

就像其他硬币（yCRV，USDT，DAI）也有策略一样，YFII的种植方式也可以相同。有流动资金池，并且为此可以使用多个智能合约场。

还可以很容易地用其他代币奖励YFII农民，这比没有奖励要好得多。

还有一个YIP-5，它向农民重新分配5％，其中应包括YFII跳马农民。

这个问题有很多技术解决方案，我对开发商和营销团队充满信心，可以为YFII农民找到有利可图的耕作策略。
