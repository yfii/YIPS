<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged YIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new YIPs. Note that an YIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your YIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `yip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Currently (and after the YIP-6 change), holding the YFII has no use other than governance. The YFII Machine gun pool has 0% APY, and has been giving no returns for 2 weeks, this needs to become the top #1 priority of the development team.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the YIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the YIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This change will add strategies for the YFII vault, that incentivize staking for YFII token holders. As the machine gun pool is supposed to look for better strategies for YFII holders, it is currently inactive. We demand that development on making the YFII vault active, becomes the top priority of the development team. 

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the YIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the YIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the YIP will address the issue!-->
We understand there are many other propositions and developments in the works for YFII, but its current value has been decreasing, coincidentally ever since people came to the realization YFII does not provide any farming benefits.
Farmers that hold other tokens are able to farm YFII, yet they have no reason to hold it. Even the upcoming iToken reward helps reward these farmers, yet again, there is nothing done to benefit the current holders of the YFII tokens.

This change will prioritize working on YFII rewards above all else, instantly creating a need not only to farm, but to buy, and stake YFII tokens. 

While this proposition sounds short-sighted, it is because it should almost be common sense. Other tokens like YFI, YFV, YFFI, all have staking mechanisms, that allow people to generate profits not from other tokens, but from the original token itself.
This YIP will help voice the community's concern, not only for this proposal, but sets the tone in the future, over if the team should focus on the benefit of YFII farmers, or focus on the benefit of other (DAI,yCRV,USDT,...) farmers.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the YIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

If this is implemented, the team will focus first on implementing new strategies for the YFII vault, above every other pool. As it is today, existing pools currently will be untouched, and will keep generating profits for their farmers, but the work will start focusing on YFII strategies, and how to create a need for acquiring and holding YFII tokens.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The problem this will solve is instantly create a need to put YFII tokens to use. At the date of this proposal, 57% of total YFII is deposited with exchanges, which are the top 3 YFII holders. This proves the point that YFII is not currently used for any purpose, other than being traded and sold. 

By fixing the YFII machine gun pool, we not only create a need for users to deposit their money into it, but invite others to purchase and hold their tokens in the vault.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces YFII Finance currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Just as other coins (yCRV, USDT, DAI) have strategies, YFII can be farmed the same way. There are liquidity pools, and multiple smart contract farms available for this.

It is also easily possible to reward YFII farmers with other tokens, which is still a lot better than no rewards. 

There is also YIP-5 which redistributes 5% to farmers, which should include YFII vault farmers.

There are many technical solutions to this problem, and I am confident in the developer and marketing team to find lucrative farming strategies for YFII farmers.
